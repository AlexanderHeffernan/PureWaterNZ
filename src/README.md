# PureWaterNZ

## Overview
PureWaterNZ is a website created as part of a school NCEA Level 1 project in 2020. The website aims to raise awareness about the state of New Zealand's waterways by providing articles, images, and other media. It serves as an educational platform to help users learn about the purity of New Zealand's water and make informed judgments.

The website includes:
- Articles on various water-related topics, such as pollution, water quality, and local waterway issues.
- A login/signup system for users to access additional features.
- A responsive design built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP.
- Integration with a MySQL database for user authentication and article management.

## Features
1. **Articles**: 
   - A collection of articles covering topics like the Hutt River, Lake Taupo, and waterborne bacteria in Queenstown.
   - Articles are accessible through the "Explore" section or directly from the homepage.

2. **User Authentication**:
   - A login/signup system built using PHP and MySQLi.
   - Users can create accounts, log in, and access additional features like creating articles.

3. **Media Integration**:
   - Images and audio files are included to enhance the user experience.
   - Interactive elements like carousels and modals are implemented using JavaScript and jQuery.

4. **Responsive Design**:
   - The website is styled with Bootstrap and custom CSS to ensure compatibility across devices.

## How to View the Website
The static version of the Pure Water NZ website is hosted on GitHub Pages. You can explore the website and its features (excluding the login system) by visiting the following link:

Please note that while the static content is fully accessible, the login/signup system and other dynamic features are non-functional in this hosted version.

## Known Issues
When the project was originally built in 2020, the login/signup system worked as intended. However, the MySQLi-based authentication system no longer functions due to changes in the environment or database configuration. This issue will need to be addressed if the project is to be revived or extended.
